# python-api-challenge

WeatherPy:

I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To do this I used the OpenWeather API to create a respresentative model of weather across world cities.

Objective:

  -   Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

  -   Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

  -   Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

  -   Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

The Final Notebook Includes:

  -   Randomly selected at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.

  -   Performed a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.

  -   Included a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.

  -   Saved both a CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot.
